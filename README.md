Predicting High Taxi Demand Regions using Social Media Check-ins


## Problem Description:

   Taxicabs are a popular mode of urban transportation because of its point-to-point service and 24-7 availability. However, the fast-growing online ride booking companies like Uber and Lyft have been adding immense pressure on the traditional taxicab industry. Often, the supply and demand of taxicabs in different regions of a city can be highly imbalanced. In some crowded regions, passengers find it difficult to get rides even after a long wait, while in some other regions, taxicabs are roaming without any passengers. A taxi demand prediction system can help solve this problem. This would allow taxicabs to compete with transportation network companies like Uber and help passengers to reduce wait times.
   The goal of this project is to predict high taxi demand regions in New York City with the help of check-in data from the location-based social networking app, Foursquare. The check-in data will be helpful in identifying the popular venues in the city. Assuming popular venues to have high taxi demand, we plan to cluster these venues into regions using their geolocations. Using the taxi trip record dataset provided by NYC Taxi and Limousine commission, and the identified popular regions, we aim to develop a predictive model to predict the high taxi demand regions.

## Datasets:
The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission [1] provides a historical dataset covering over 1 billion individual taxi trips in the city from January 2009 through December 2017. Each trip record includes information such as pick-up and drop-off times, coordinates, trip duration, passenger count, payment, and so on. The Foursquare NYC dataset [2] contains 227,428 check-ins by users in the New York City. It contains all popular venues in NYC grouped into 8 different categories: Arts & Entertainment, College & University, Food, Great Outdoors, Home &Work, Nightlife Spot, Shop and Travel Spot.
